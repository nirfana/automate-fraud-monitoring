## Automated Fraud Transaction Monitoring
Implement an automated fraud transaction monitoring system using Apache Airflow to identify areas with higher fraud rates, enabling optimal decision-making for handling fraud and ensuring a safer transaction environment while improving customer trust.

Once the fraud detection algorithm has classified the transactions, the process involves storing the results in a database, fetching the data, and uploading it to Elasticsearch for monitoring using Kibana.
